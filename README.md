# 💨 Leak Pro

## 🔍 Description

**Leak Pro** is a smart household **gas leak detection and alert system** that automatically shuts off the gas supply upon detection — no human intervention needed. Built as a hardware prototype using various modules, this system helps prevent major accidents at the source. We’ve demonstrated this model to peers and gathered valuable feedback to improve future iterations.
